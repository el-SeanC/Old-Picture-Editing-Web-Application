## Old Web Application Project Allowing Users To Edit & Enhance Their Pictures

### Problems I Encountered:
 • Image did not load properly from API.  
 • Image did not take on CSS edit properties.  
 • Site would not load properly after using custom domain.  

### How They Were Fixed:
 • Reconfigured app.get to properly receive our requested image.  
 • Used module.exports to export function to ReactJS project.  
 • Reconfigured React Router with basename.  

#### Application Created w/ HTML5, CSS3, ReactJS & Bootstrap.
